# Pigeon Spikes & Netting: Installation Guide and Use Cases

Pigeons and birds can cause nuisance on ledges, ducts, and balconies in Indore and nearby areas. **Pigeon spikes** and **pigeon netting** are two common solutions. This guide explains use cases, installation basics, and where to buy in Siyaganj so you can choose the right option.

## Pigeon Spikes (Bird Spikes)

Pigeon spikes are strips of plastic or stainless steel with upward-pointing spikes. They are fixed on ledges, parapets, sign boards, and beams so birds cannot land. They don’t harm birds but discourage perching.

- **Plastic spikes** — UV-stabilized; economical; suitable for most ledges.
- **SS (stainless steel) spikes** — Stronger and more durable; used where appearance or long life matters.

[Pigeon Spikes](/products/pigeon-spikes) are available in plastic and SS from Siyaganj suppliers.

## Pigeon Netting

Pigeon netting is a mesh (nylon or HDPE) that blocks birds from entering balconies, ducts, windows, and shafts. It is fixed with hooks or frames and is almost invisible from a distance.

- **Use** — Balconies, windows, duct openings, and open shafts.
- **Material** — Nylon or HDPE; various colours and mesh sizes.

[Pigeon Net](/products/pigeon-nets) is available in different sizes; custom cut to fit is common.

## Use Cases in Indore

In Indore, Siyaganj, and residential and commercial buildings:

- **Ledges and parapets** — Spikes are ideal. Fix along the length of the ledge.
- **Balconies and ducts** — Netting is better to block entry while allowing airflow.
- **Sign boards and canopies** — Spikes on top prevent birds from sitting.
- **Terraces** — Combination of spikes on parapet and netting for open areas if needed.

Projects in Dewas, Pithampur, and Ujjain also use spikes and netting for similar applications.

## Installation Basics

**Spikes:**  
- Clean the surface. Use adhesive (recommended by manufacturer) or cable ties to fix the spike strip. Ensure full coverage so birds can’t land between strips.

**Netting:**  
- Measure the opening. Fix hooks or frame at the perimeter. Stretch and attach the net. Keep tension even so it doesn’t sag.

For large or high areas, consider professional installers. Suppliers in Siyaganj can often suggest installers or methods.

## What Affects Price?

- **Spikes** — Price per metre; plastic is cheaper than SS. Length and quantity matter.
- **Netting** — Price per sq m; depends on size, material, and custom cutting.

## FAQs

**Which is better, spikes or netting?**  
Spikes suit ledges and flat surfaces where you want to prevent perching. Netting suits openings like balconies and ducts where you need to block entry.

**Do spikes harm birds?**  
No. They only make landing uncomfortable so birds move elsewhere.

**Can I install pigeon spikes myself?**  
Yes, on low ledges with adhesive or cable ties. For high or large areas, professional installation is safer.
