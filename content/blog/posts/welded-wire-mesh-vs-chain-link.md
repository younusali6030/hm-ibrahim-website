# Welded Wire Mesh vs Chain Link: Cost, Strength, and Use Cases

In Indore, Siyaganj, and Loha Mandi, both **welded wire mesh (weldmesh)** and **chain link** are used for fencing and partitioning. They differ in how they are made, how strong they are, and what they cost. This guide helps you choose.

## What is Welded Wire Mesh (Weldmesh)?

Welded wire mesh is made by welding wires at each crossing to form a rigid grid. It is supplied in rolls or sheets. Common mesh sizes in Indore include 15x15 mm, 50x50 mm, 75x75 mm, and 100x100 mm. It is used for RCC slab reinforcement, partitions, cages, and sometimes boundary fencing. [GI Weldmesh](/products/gi-weldmesh) and [MS Weldmesh](/products/ms-weldmesh) are available from Siyaganj suppliers.

## What is Chain Link?

Chain link is a woven mesh of wire that is flexible and typically galvanized or PVC-coated. Mesh openings are usually 1" to 4", and heights from 3 ft to 10 ft. It is very common for compound boundaries, sports grounds, and industrial sites in Indore and nearby Dewas, Pithampur, and Ujjain. See [Chain Link Fencing](/products/chain-link-fencing) for options.

## Strength and Rigidity

- **Welded mesh** — Rigid; holds its shape. Good for panels, cages, and reinforcement. Less flexible for uneven terrain.
- **Chain link** — Flexible; follows contours. Good for long boundary runs and curved sections.

## Cost and Use Cases

- **Welded mesh** — Price depends on mesh size, wire gauge, and material (MS vs GI). Often used where a flat, rigid panel is needed (partitions, reinforcement).
- **Chain link** — Price depends on mesh size, wire gauge, height, and finish (GI vs PVC). Typically used for full-height boundary fencing.

In Siyaganj and Loha Mandi, contractors often use chain link for compound walls and weldmesh for internal partitions or RCC work.

## When to Use Which in Indore

- **Boundary fencing** — Chain link is the usual choice for perimeter in Indore and the region.
- **RCC slabs, partitions, cages** — Welded mesh (GI or MS) is standard.
- **Industrial partitioning** — Either can work; weldmesh gives a flatter, stiffer panel.

## FAQs

**Which lasts longer outdoors in Indore?**  
Both GI weldmesh and GI chain link resist corrosion. PVC-coated chain link adds extra life. MS will rust if not painted or galvanized.

**Do you deliver weldmesh to Pithampur?**  
Many Siyaganj suppliers serve Indore and nearby areas. Confirm delivery when requesting a quote.

**How do I get a quote?**  
Specify product (weldmesh or chain link), mesh size, wire gauge, dimensions or area, and quantity. Request a quote for current Indore rates.
