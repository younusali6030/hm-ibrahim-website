# How to Choose TMT Bars in Indore: Grades, Brands, and Use

TMT (thermo-mechanically treated) bars are the standard reinforcement for RCC construction in Indore, Siyaganj, and across Madhya Pradesh. This guide explains grades, common sizes, and how to choose the right TMT bars for your project—and where to get them in Siyaganj or Loha Mandi.

## What Are TMT Bars?

TMT bars are steel bars that are heat-treated to improve strength and ductility. They have a hardened outer layer and a softer core, which helps in earthquake-resistant design. In Indore, TMT bars are used for columns, beams, slabs, and foundations in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.

## Grades of TMT Bars

Common grades available in Indore include:

- **Fe 500** — Most common for general RCC work. Meets IS 1786.
- **Fe 550** — Higher strength; used where the design calls for it.
- **Fe 500D** — Better ductility; suitable for seismic zones.

Your structural engineer will specify the grade. For most buildings in Indore and nearby Dewas, Pithampur, and Ujjain, Fe 500 is standard.

## Common Sizes in Indore

TMT bars are supplied in diameters such as 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, 16 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, and 32 mm, typically in 12 m length. The most used sizes for columns, beams, and slabs are 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, 16 mm, and 20 mm. [TMT Bars](/products/tmt-bars) in these sizes are available from Siyaganj suppliers.

## How to Choose

1. **Follow the design** — Use the grade and sizes specified in your structural drawing.
2. **Check rib pattern** — Proper deformation (ribs) ensures bond with concrete.
3. **Source from a known supplier** — Buy from established dealers in Siyaganj or Loha Mandi who stock quality bars.
4. **Quantity** — Order in bulk where possible for better rates; confirm delivery to site.

## Price Factors (No Fixed Prices)

TMT bar rates in Indore depend on diameter, grade, quantity, and market. Larger diameters and higher grades cost more per kg. We do not publish fixed prices; request a quote with diameter, grade, and quantity for current rates.
