# Best Practices for Storing Steel & Wire Products (Warehouse)

Contractors and traders in Indore, Siyaganj, and Loha Mandi often store steel, wire, and mesh on site or in a warehouse. Poor storage leads to rust, bent material, and mix-up of sizes. This guide gives simple best practices so your stock stays in good condition after you buy from a Siyaganj supplier.

## 1. Keep Steel Off the Ground

Place sections, TMT bars, and pipes on **sleepers (wood or concrete)** or racks so they don’t sit on wet or muddy ground. This reduces rust and damage to the bottom layer.

- **TMT bars** — Stack in bundles on sleepers; avoid direct soil contact.
- **Angles, flats, channels** — Store on racks or pallets.
- **Pipes** — Same; keep ends clean and off ground.

## 2. Cover From Rain and Sun

Where possible, store under shed or tarpaulin. Rain and humidity cause rust on MS and even GI over time. Sun and heat are less harmful but covering still helps keep stock clean.

- **Wire mesh and weldmesh** — Keep rolls under cover; avoid standing water.
- **Binding wire, GI wire** — Store in dry place; coils can be covered with plastic if open.

## 3. Organize by Size and Type

- **Label** bundles or racks (e.g. “50x50 angle 5 mm”, “TMT 12 mm Fe 500”).
- **Separate** different sizes and grades so you don’t pick the wrong material for the job.
- **FIFO** — Use older stock first so nothing sits too long.

This is especially important when you have multiple sizes of [MS Angles](/products/ms-angles), [TMT Bars](/products/tmt-bars), [GI Wire](/products/gi-wire), and [Chain Link](/products/chain-link-fencing).

## 4. Wire and Mesh

- **Coils** — Store upright or on racks; avoid kinking.
- **Mesh rolls** — Keep flat or vertical; don’t crush. Keep dry.
- **Binding wire** — In dry place; avoid moisture to reduce rust.

## 5. Small Items (Nails, Clamps, Tools)

- Keep in **boxes or bins** with labels.
- **Dry store** — Nails and fasteners rust in humidity; keep in dry area.
- **Welding rods** — Store in dry place; once opened, use or reseal to avoid moisture.

See [Nails](/categories/nails), [Construction Tools](/categories/construction-tools), and [Wires](/categories/wires) for products that need careful storage.

## 6. Safety

- **Stack height** — Don’t stack too high; risk of collapse.
- **Walking access** — Keep aisles clear so no one trips on bars or wire.
- **Sharp edges** — Handle and stack with care; use gloves where needed.

## Summary

- Off the ground, under cover, organized by type and size.
- Keep wire and mesh dry; use FIFO.
- Label and separate to avoid wrong size or grade on site.

Following these practices in Indore, Dewas, Pithampur, or Ujjain will keep your steel and wire in good condition from delivery until use.
