# How to Estimate Material Quantity for Fencing Projects

Estimating fencing material correctly helps you budget and order the right quantity from a Siyaganj or Loha Mandi supplier. This guide covers chain link, barbed wire, posts, and GI pipe so you can plan your fencing project in Indore, Dewas, Pithampur, or Ujjain.

## Step 1: Measure the Perimeter

- Walk or measure the boundary line where the fence will go.
- Add gate openings (you will not put mesh on the gate itself, but you need post positions).
- Total length (in metres) = perimeter. For example, 100 m x 4 sides = 400 m for a square plot.

## Step 2: Chain Link Mesh

- **Length** — Same as perimeter (e.g. 400 m). Add 5–10% for overlap at joints and waste.
- **Height** — Choose 3 ft, 4 ft, 5 ft, 6 ft, 8 ft, or 10 ft. Standard rolls are sold by length and height.
- **Area** — Length × height = area in sq m. Example: 400 m × 6 ft (1.83 m) ≈ 732 sq m. Order slightly more.

[Chain Link Fencing](/products/chain-link-fencing) is available in various mesh sizes and heights from Siyaganj suppliers.

## Step 3: Barbed Wire (If Used on Top)

- **Length** — Usually 2–4 strands along the top. So length = perimeter × number of strands. Add a little for tying.
- **Weight** — Depends on gauge and coil. Coils are often 5 kg to 25 kg. Order by length or weight as per supplier.

See [Barbed Wire](/products/barbed-wire) for types and packing.

## Step 4: Posts (Angle or GI Pipe)

- **Spacing** — Typically 2.5 m to 3 m between posts. So number of posts ≈ perimeter ÷ 2.5 (or 3).
- **Corner and gate posts** — Add 2–4 extra for corners and gate sides.
- **Height** — Post height = fence height + embedment (e.g. 0.5–1 m in ground).

[GI Pipes](/products/gi-pipes) or [MS Angles](/products/ms-angles) are often used as posts. Specify diameter or size and length.

## Step 5: Fixings and Binding

- **Binding wire** — For tying mesh to posts and tying barbed wire. Rough estimate: 1–2 kg per 10 m of fence, depending on design.
- **Clamps or clips** — If using wire rope or tensioning; count per post or per run.

[Binding Wire](/products/binding-wire) and [GI Wire](/products/gi-wire) are available in Siyaganj.

## Example (100 m × 100 m Plot)

- Perimeter = 400 m.
- Chain link: 400 m × 1.05 = 420 m length, height 6 ft → order by sq m or roll length as per supplier.
- Posts: 400 ÷ 2.5 ≈ 160, plus 4 for corners = 164 posts.
- Barbed wire (2 strands on top): 400 × 2 = 800 m length (or equivalent weight in coils).

Adjust for gates and uneven ground. Request a quote with your dimensions; many Siyaganj suppliers can help double-check quantities.

## Request a Quote in Indore / Siyaganj

For chain link, barbed wire, GI pipe, or binding wire in Indore, Siyaganj, or Loha Mandi, send your perimeter, height, and post spacing for a quantity and price quote.
