# Common Mistakes When Buying Steel Sections (Angles, Flats)

Buying MS angles, flats, channels, and other sections in Indore, Siyaganj, or Loha Mandi can go wrong if you don’t specify size, quantity, and quality clearly. Here are common mistakes and how to avoid them—so you get the right material from your Siyaganj supplier.

## 1. Not Specifying Size and Thickness Precisely

Angles and flats come in many sizes. “Angle” could mean 25x25 mm or 75x75 mm; thickness can be 3 mm or 6 mm. If you don’t specify, you may get the wrong size or a size the supplier assumes.

**Fix:** Always specify exact size and thickness, e.g. “MS angle 50x50 mm, 5 mm thick, 6 m length.” Same for [MS Flats](/products/ms-flats) and [MS Channels](/products/ms-channels).

## 2. Ordering by “pieces” Without Length

Sections are sold by weight (per kg) or by length (per metre). “10 pieces” is unclear if length is 6 m or 12 m.

**Fix:** Specify length (6 m or 12 m) and number of pieces, or total metres. For [MS Angles](/products/ms-angles), state size, thickness, length, and quantity.

## 3. Ignoring Straightness and Surface

Bent or twisted angles and flats cause rework on site. Surface scale or rust may be acceptable for some uses but not for visible or precision work.

**Fix:** Check a sample when possible. For critical work, mention “straight and clean” or ask for a better grade. Inspect on delivery.

## 4. Not Accounting for Wastage

Cutting and fitting always produce some waste. Ordering exact length with no extra leads to shortage.

**Fix:** Add 5–10% for wastage (or more for complex fabrication). Discuss with your fabricator or supplier in Siyaganj.

## 5. Choosing Black MS for Outdoor Without Protection

Black MS angles and flats rust when exposed to rain and humidity. Using them outdoors without paint or galvanizing shortens life.

**Fix:** For outdoor use in Indore, consider galvanized sections or plan for painting. [MS Channels](/products/ms-channels) and angles are available in black; ask for galvanized if needed.

## 6. Not Getting a Written Quote

Rates change. Verbal “approximate” prices can differ from final bill.

**Fix:** Get a written quote with size, thickness, length, quantity, and rate (per kg or per piece). Keep it for comparison and payment.
