# Perforated Sheets: MS vs GI, Hole Patterns, and Applications

Perforated sheets are metal sheets with a regular pattern of holes. In Indore, Siyaganj, and Loha Mandi they are used for screens, ventilation, filtration, and architectural facades. This guide covers material choice (MS vs GI), hole patterns, and typical applications so you can order the right product from a Siyaganj supplier.

## Materials: MS vs GI Perforated Sheets

- **MS (mild steel) perforated sheets** — Economical; suitable for indoor use or where they will be painted or galvanized later. Used for screens, machine guards, and ventilation in Indore and nearby areas.
- **GI (galvanized iron) perforated sheets** — Zinc-coated; better for outdoor and humid conditions. Common for external screens, ducts, and industrial applications in Siyaganj and Loha Mandi.

[GI Perforated Sheet](/products/gi-perforated-sheet) and [MS Perforated Sheet](/products/ms-perforated-sheet) are available in various thicknesses and patterns.

## Hole Patterns

Common patterns include:

- **Round holes** — Most common; various diameters and pitch.
- **Square holes** — For screening and certain architectural looks.
- **Slot holes** — Elongated; good for airflow and directional screening.
- **Hexagonal** — Less common; used for specific designs.

Thickness typically ranges from 0.5 mm to 3 mm. Choice depends on load, visibility, and airflow needs.

## Applications in Indore

In Indore, Dewas, Pithampur, and Ujjain, perforated sheets are used for:

- **Ventilation** — Ducts, grilles, and machine enclosures.
- **Screening** — Partitions, facades, and security screens.
- **Filtration** — Sieves and industrial filters.
- **Architectural** — Sun screens and decorative panels.

Suppliers in Siyaganj and New Siyaganj stock MS and GI perforated sheets in standard and custom sizes.

## What Affects Price?

Price depends on material (MS vs GI), thickness, hole pattern, open area, and quantity. Custom patterns or small orders may cost more per sq m. Request a quote with material, thickness, pattern, and dimensions for current Indore rates.

## How to Choose

- **Indoor / painted** — MS is often enough.
- **Outdoor / humid** — Prefer GI for corrosion resistance.
- **Ventilation** — Consider open area and slot vs round holes.
- **Strength** — Thicker sheet and smaller holes increase strength.
