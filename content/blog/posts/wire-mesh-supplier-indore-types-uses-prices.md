# Wire Mesh Supplier in Indore: Types, Uses, and Price Factors

If you are looking for wire mesh in Indore, Siyaganj, or Loha Mandi, you have several types to choose from. This guide explains the main varieties, where they are used, and what affects their price—so you can plan your purchase and get a quote that fits your project.

## Types of Wire Mesh Available in Indore

Wire mesh in Indore is typically supplied as **MS wire mesh**, **GI wire mesh**, **welded mesh (weldmesh)**, and **crimp wire mesh**. Each type has different strength, corrosion resistance, and cost.

- **MS wire mesh** — Mild steel, economical, used for reinforcement and screening. Suitable for indoor or painted applications.
- **GI wire mesh** — Galvanized; better for outdoor and humid environments. Common in Siyaganj and Loha Mandi for boundary and industrial use.
- **Welded mesh (GI weldmesh, MS weldmesh)** — Wires welded at crossings; strong and rigid. Used for RCC slabs, partitions, and cages.
- **Crimp wire mesh** — Wires crimped at intersections; good for screening and sifting. Available in MS and GI.

## Common Uses of Wire Mesh in Indore and Nearby Areas

In Indore, Madhya Pradesh, wire mesh is used for:

- **Construction** — Reinforcement in RCC slabs, walls, and plaster (e.g. fiber mesh).

Contractors and bulk buyers in New Siyaganj and Loha Mandi often order welded mesh for slabs and GI mesh for outdoor fencing.

## What Affects Wire Mesh Price in Indore?

Prices are not fixed; they depend on:

- **Mesh size** — Smaller openings and thicker wire usually cost more per sq m.
- **Material** — GI is typically more expensive than MS; PVC-coated more than plain GI.
- **Quantity** — Bulk orders from a Siyaganj or Loha Mandi supplier often get better per-unit rates.
- **Market rates** — Steel and zinc prices influence wire and mesh rates.

Always request a quote with your specification (mesh size, wire gauge, material, and quantity) for current rates in Indore.

## How to Choose the Right Wire Mesh

- For **reinforcement** in concrete: welded mesh (GI or MS) in the mesh size specified by your engineer.
- For **outdoor fencing**: GI or PVC-coated mesh for longer life in Indore’s climate.
- For **screening/sifting**: crimp mesh in the aperture and gauge that suit your process.
