# GI Wire vs MS Wire: Which One for Binding and Fencing?

In Indore, Siyaganj, and Loha Mandi, both **GI (galvanized iron) wire** and **MS (mild steel) wire** are used for binding, tying, and fencing. Choosing the right type saves cost and improves durability. This guide compares them and points you to products you can order from a Siyaganj supplier.

## What is GI Wire?

GI wire is mild steel wire coated with zinc (galvanized). It resists rust better than bare MS wire, so it is preferred for outdoor use, fencing, and binding where the wire may get wet or exposed. [GI Wire](/products/gi-wire) is available in gauges such as 8 SWG to 18 SWG in coils.

## What is MS Wire?

MS wire is uncoated or lightly coated mild steel wire. It is cheaper than GI but can rust when exposed to moisture. It is used for indoor binding, temporary tying, and where cost is a priority and exposure is limited. Binding wire for RCC is often annealed MS wire—see [Binding Wire](/products/binding-wire).

## Binding and Tying

- **RCC binding** — Annealed binding wire (MS) is standard for tying reinforcement. It is soft and easy to twist. GI is not typically used for rebar tying.
- **General tying** — For bundling, packaging, or light outdoor tying, GI wire lasts longer; MS is cheaper for short-term or indoor use.

## Fencing

- **Fencing** — GI wire is better for boundary and farm fencing in Indore’s climate because it resists corrosion. MS wire will rust if used outdoors unless painted.
- **Jhatka / agricultural** — [Jhatka Wire](/products/jhatka-machine-fencing-wire) and fencing wire in GI are common for farm and boundary use in Dewas, Pithampur, and Ujjain.

## Price and Durability

GI wire costs more per kg than MS but lasts longer outdoors. For fencing and external use, GI usually gives better value over time. For RCC binding, use binding wire as specified; for other tying, choose GI if exposed, MS if indoor and cost-sensitive.

## Where to Buy in Indore

Suppliers in Siyaganj and Loha Mandi stock GI wire and binding wire in various gauges and pack sizes. Request a quote with gauge and quantity for current rates. See [Wires](/categories/wires) for the full range including [Concertina Wire](/products/concertina-wire) and wire ropes.

## FAQs

**Can I use MS wire for outdoor fencing?**  
MS will rust. For outdoor fencing in Indore, use GI wire or coated wire for longer life.

**What gauge of GI wire for binding?**  
Binding for RCC uses annealed binding wire (e.g. 16–18 SWG), not general GI wire. For other tying, choose gauge as per load.

**Do you have Tata Wiron GI wire?**  
Some Siyaganj suppliers stock Tata Wiron GI wire. Ask when requesting a quote.
